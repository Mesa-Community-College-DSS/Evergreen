# Project Evergreen
Project Evergreen is being developed with a set of new scripts to "Evergreen" our most commonly updated software.

What does this mean? An evergreen application in our environment will check the vendors website for the latest version. If it is determined the software has a new release, it will download and update the software. This will be handled by a scheduled task running a Powershell script running nightly.
